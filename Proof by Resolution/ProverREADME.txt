Names: Patrick Deng
Source Files: Prover.py
Platform: Linux(lubuntu) (Pycharm IDE)
Problems/Challenges:
			Getting the program to avoid duplicate clauses - it loops for a long time
			Finding a heuristic for picking clauses to resolve, for quick evaluations to False and fast search for a contradiction.
			Getting the program to avoid meaningless but true clauses - it loops again, for a long time

		

How to execute:

Step 1: run the Prover program

type in console: python Prover.py <filename of variables> 

example: python Prover.py ex1.var1 ex1.con none
